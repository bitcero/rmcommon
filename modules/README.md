This folder contains the theme __redmexico__ for __system__ module. This theme is required by __Common Utilities__ in order to enable all its grapic features.

### How to use this theme?

_before toinstall rmcommon_ please upload this folder (or `system` folder) to your XOOPS `modules` directory. If this is the first time that you install __rmcommon__ then anything will be replaced, but if you've previously installed __rmcommon__ then the folder will replace existing files from `redmexico` theme. Don`t worry for this... 

After copy the files, you can install __Common Utilities__ normally.
