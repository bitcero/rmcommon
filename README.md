========

**Common Utilities** is a framework oriented to develop advanced XOOPS modules by providing useful objects and new methods for developers.
Development work turns more easy while Common Utilities provide new capabilities to create a new kind of components for XOOPS.

Also, **Common Utilities** transform the XOOPS default GUI into a new styled adn improved Admin GUI, with the target of improve the usability
and the look and feel of all modules.

Modules and plugins created with **Common Utilities** will be integrated in a top and low level with the entire system, and the interoperation
between modules will be a reality.

**Common Utilities** counts with a integrated update system that will be more easy to maintain modules and plugins updated. The advantages are obvious:
More security, more stability and the last features with every module.
